Hi

This is an addon for Blender. Should work on 4.0, definetly works up to 3.6.5.
It is for personal use so inconsistent comments, apologies. 
It's purpose is to manage the scene in different ways. And perform actions on N objects at a time.
No requisites required, accessed in the panel (N). 

Biggest script is "Organise for Maya" it is amost a blender to maya bridge (BoM).
It rehashes the entire scene to make it exportable to Maya in an organised manner.
Deals will al types of modifiers and objects (all types that I personnaly ever used)
BEWARE it does not support scenes with disabled collections (the checkbox enable/disable)
